**DCI Curriculum and Materials:**

# Web Development

**An 11 month track to train entry-level web developers**

The following pages describe the 11 month web development curriculum. Each folder above represents a **Top Level Module (TLM)** of the curriculum. Each **_TLM_** Contains in turn a set of folder to represent **Sub Modules (SM)**, which contains a set of learning objectives, topics to be learned, and exercises to be practiced in class.

### Our topics materials will be added gradually at the time of teaching it.

## Linear TLM

To fully understand the material in the curriculum, we can represent it as a dependency graph, where each module is preceeded to it's **_prerequisites_**.

The following graph represents potential tracks in order to grow our knowledge from Basic Literacy to the final project. The curriculum should be learned one module at a time and following the progressive order of the modules

- The dashed Lines between the Top Level Modules, represent the phase of the curriculum in which the module is and is denoted by a letter. Each of these phases is calleda **_curriculum category_**

## Category Is...

In order to profile the main focus of each module and be able to create different types of exercises for different types of modules we can use the help of categories. Each category in the outline that follows represents a different collection of possible required lessons, exercises and activities.

### Category A - Preparatory

Modules in category A represents preparatory materials that require constant use throughout the year.

- [Basic Digital Literacy](./A_Basic-Digital-Literacy)

### Category B - Basics

Modules in this category are study units that are designed to introduce language and concepts. Lessons in these modules will be slightly more frontal than other modules, and plenty of smaller and more concise exercises should be included.

- [UI Basics](./B_UI-Basics)
- [Programming Basics](./B_Programming-Basics)

### Category C - Environments

This category encomapsses modules that take already learned language concepts and dives deeper into potential use cases for them. Ideally the lessons at this point should be briefer with examples that rely on basic understanding. The exercises are longer and will should encourage the learners to rely on documentation, rather than on the instructor.

- [Browser](./C_Browser)
- [Node](./C_Node)

### Category D - Implementations

The third category represents the learning of various architectures, patterns, and (close to) real life projects. The lessons in modules that belong to this category should be as brief as possible (as long as no new concepts are introduced) and focus more on implementation detail rather than theory. These modules are all accompanied by a module long example project which will be coded incrementally in front and with the help of the learners. In parallel, the projects in this category are equally long in form and should be worked on at the second part of the day.
